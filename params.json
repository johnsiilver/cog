Crush downtime.\r\n\r\n### Introducing Cogs\r\nCogs represents a capability upgrade system.  This plugin system allows a developer to upgrade or extend a system's capabilities without introducing downtime.\r\n\r\nDesigned for use with the upcoming Marmot Workflow Execution Engine, Cogs provide a needed capability for services that need modification without scheduled downtime.\r\n\r\n### How Does it Work\r\nCogs are built on Google's GRPC framework.  The Cog client library allows mounting and un-mounting of Cog plugins that run a specialized GRPC service.  This service can only be communicated with by the Cog client that created it.  \r\n\r\nThe Cogs client library can detect when the source binary of a Cog is changed and upgrade the running Cog to the new version at any time.  Existing connection will bleed off while the new Cog begins processing new requests.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJohn Doak (@johnsiilver)",
